## LUMI 
### Getting on LUMI
To run the project on LUMI, you need to have a LUMI account and add your SSH key to it. Please check the [online instructions on how to do that](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/firststeps/SSH-keys/). Once you have your SSH key added, you can login to LUMI by running `ssh -i <your-private-key> <username>@@lumi.csc.fi`. Once logged in, create a SSH key and add that to your GitHub account so you can clone the repo. Then, please follow the download, install and usage instructions provided in the [README](https://github.com/destination-earth-digital-twins/Deode-Prototype/blob/develop/README.md) file.

### Ecflow:  Initial setup

** Do not proceed to other steps til this is complete **

1. First step is to email ECMWF (cristina.duma@ecmwf.int with samet.demir@ecmwf.int; bojan.kasic@ecmwf.int in cc), providing them with: 

a) Your **LUMI username** (USERNAME in the rest of this document).

b) Your **LUMI public key** (usually under: /users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

And ask to be 'whitelisted' to be granted access to the Ecflow server from LUMI.

2. You need to copy the following **encrypted** files from this location: (/pfs/lustrep4/projappl/project_465000527/shared/LUMI_ECFLOW/)

a) server.ssl.gpg - an ssl certificate file

b) 217.71.195.251.8443.ecf.custom_passwd.gpg - ecf custom password file

c) id_rsa_troika.pub.gpg - public key for troika

3. Decrypt them with the following command:
```shell
gpg filename
```
using the **password: 'peterpiper'**.

4. It is recommend that you then put these files in the following locations:

a) /users/USERNAME/.ecflowrc/ssl/server.crt

b) /users/USERNAME/ecflow_server/217.71.195.251.8443.ecf.custom_passwd

**Note** The public key: 'id_rsa_troika.pub' needs to be uploaded to my.csc.fi or myaccessid provider.

5. Then map custom password and SSL variable as follows:

```shell
export ECF_CUSTOM_PASSWD="/users/USERNAME/ecflow_server/217.71.195.251.8443.ecf.custom_passwd"
export ECF_SSL=1
```

Which should look like this:
```shell
adelsaid@uan01:/users/adelsaid> cat /users/USERNAME/ecflow_server/217.71.195.251.8443.ecf.custom_passwd
5.11.3
de_330 217.71.195.251 8443 {PASSWORD_OBTAINED_FROM_ECMWF}
```
Note: For now, the above file is the **same for every user**.

#### Testing Ecflow server connection

Only once these steps are completed, test your connection by pinging (you have to load the ecflow module first as described in the next section):
```shell
ecflow_client --ping --host 217.71.195.251 --port 8443
```
If there are any obvious errors, rechart your steps by starting again. 

Another litmus test for Ecflow working well is logging into the ecflow server:
```shell
ssh ecflow-user@217.71.195.251
```

Only once you have a working connection should you attempt to setup Ecflow UI below.

#### Setting up Ecflow UI

1. To bring up the Ecflow User Interface you need the following modules, by doing 'module load' (ml):

```shell
ml use /scratch/project_465000527/jasinskas/scl/modules/
ml scl-ftn16_23
ml scl-ecflow_23
```
then
```shell
ecflow_ui &
```

2. On the ecflow_ui itself go to: "Servers > Manage Servers > Add Server" and set the following:

```
Name: de330-prod
Host: 217.71.195.251
Port: 8443
Custom user: de_330

And make sure you check these flags:
"Use SSL”:  (check)
"Add server to current view":  (check)
```

#### Troubleshooting

1. Once Ecflow is setup on LUMI you need to login as follows:

```shell
ssh -X USERNAME@lumi.csc.fi
```
(use the -A flag if you have any problems with the -X flag above). Graphics are needed to see the Ecflow graphic UI.

2. Once Ecflow UI is loaded, if your server (de330) is gray in colour, that means something has failed. To get an idea of the problem, click on 'Panel' then 'Add info panel' which will divide the ecflow ui screen and give you a message. Retrace the steps above and ensure
   
3. If you make any changes after solving issues with your Ecflow functionality, **you must reset ecflow_ui**. To do this: close it, and reissue the command `ecflow_ui &`.

4. Here is a checklist of things you need to ensure you have for the ecflow ui to run:
    
    a) Correct environment:
    ```shell
    ml use /scratch/project_465000527/jasinskas/scl/modules/
    ml scl-ftn16_23
    ml scl-ecflow_23
    ```
    b) Correct ECF variables 
    ```shell
    export ECF_CUSTOM_PASSWD="/users/USERNAME/ecflow_server/217.71.195.251.8443.ecf.custom_password"
    export ECF_SSL=1
    ```
    c) You are inside the correct folder ($DEODE) where you did `git clone`
    
    d) You did `poetry install` inside your $DEODE folder.
    
    e) You spawned `poetry shell` inside your $DEODE folder.

5. (FYI) The ecflow scheduler variables live inside: 
```shell
deode/data/config_files/include/scheduler/ecflow_lumi.toml
```
which look like:
```toml
[ecfvars]
  ecf_files = "/users/@USER@/deode_ecflow/ecf_files"
  ecf_files_remotely = "/home/ecflow-user/deode_ecflow/ecf_files"
  ecf_home = "/home/ecflow/deode_ecflow/ecf_files"
  ecf_host = "217.71.195.251"
  ecf_jobout = "/users/@USER@/deode_ecflow/jobout"
  ecf_out = "@SCRATCH@/deode_ecflow/ecf_files/"
  hpc = "lumi"
```
and are preset to default values. These can be changed in the file as required.

6. If you get an errors related to publickey, similar to this:
```shell
ssh ecflow-user@217.71.195.251
The authenticity of host '217.71.195.251 (217.71.195.251)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is ----
Are you sure you want to continue connection (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '217.71.195.251' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
ecflow-user@217.71.195.251: Permission denied (publickey).
```
check:

a) You have been whitelisted by ECMWF according to your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` key (NOT `id_rsa_troika.pub`)

b) You have added the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to your csc.fi profile (or myaccessid if you use that).

### Running DEODE on LUMI

The following command launches DEODE on LUMI
```shell
deode start suite --config-file $PWD/deode/data/config_files/config_CY48t3_lumi.toml
```

Note: if you forget to use the --config-file flag, it will default to `--config-file $PWD/deode/data/config_files/config.toml` most likely causing errors.

#### Data

At the time of writing this, there is no streamlined way to obtain data from sources such as MARS etc, as it is with ATOS. We currently have a shared local directory on LUMI for this project:
```shell
/scratch/project_465000527/de_33050_common_data/
```
spend a few minutes just familiarising yourself with what's there. 

IFS data for the boundaries (HRES and ATOS_DT) is currently stored here:
```shell
/scratch/project_465000527/de_33050_common_data/deode_ref/IFS
```

Should you require any extra data you will need to manually download this from ATOS yourself:
```shell
scp -r /home/snh02/work/dev-CY46h1_deode/climate/DEODE_LARGE adelsaid@lumi.csc.fi:/scratch/project_465000527/adelsaid/
```
for example.

If you foresee that the data you download will be needed in the long term, contact a super user (Ulf Andrae, Denis Haumont, Trygve Aspelien) to assist you in getting it into the common area mentioned above, where it should be safer in the long term.

#### Standalone task example (forecast)

To run a standalone "Forecast" task, first you need to change the 'SCHOST' field from "lumi-batch" to "lumi" under [parallel], as shown below:

```shell
[parallel]
  NPROC = 16
  SCHOST = "lumi"
  tasks = ["Forecast", "e927", "Pgd", "Prep", "c903"]
  WRAPPER = "srun"

```

in: deode/data/config_files/include/submiossion/lumi_CY48t3.toml.

This also applies to any task one wishes to run standalone. Then simply run the following comment below:

```shell
deode run \
      --config-file $PWD/deode/data/config_files/config_CY48t3_lumi.toml \
      --task Forecast \
      --template $PWD/deode/templates/stand_alone.py \
      --job $PWD/forecast.job \
      --output $PWD/forecast.log
```
