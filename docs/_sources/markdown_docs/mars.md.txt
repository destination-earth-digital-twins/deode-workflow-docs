#MARS on LUMI

Since some fields are not available directly on LUMI, we retrieve them from ATOS. To be able to do this you need to add .ecmwfapirc file to your $HOME as described here: [](https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/). Make sure that you are logged in to ECMWF when you visit the page, otherwise the page will not be displayed.
